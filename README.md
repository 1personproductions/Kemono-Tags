Kemono Tags (Unofficial Tag Organizer)

A simple desktop app I made to help organize and bookmark tags from Kemono Party. 
It’s unofficial, totally offline, and just meant to make sorting through tags easier.

What it does:

-Shows tag names and the number of posts under each.

-Click and drag a tag to open it in your browser.

-Add your own tags and set the post count manually.

-Edit tags with the pencil icon.

-Select tags to delete with a checkbox, with a counter showing how many you’ve picked.

-Highlight important tags with the “Keep highlights” toggle.

How to use:

-Click and drag a tag into your browser to open the link.

-Everything is customizable. You can add, edit, or delete tags however you want.

Notes:

-Not affiliated with Kemono Party.

-Numbers are manual, they don’t auto-update from the site.

-Designed for personal organization and faster browsing.

A little about why I made this:

I love doing deep dives for assets just for fun, but I’ve always hated manually hunting for tags on the site and keeping them in a text file. 
I spent a lot of time figuring out the best tags for asset-finding, which you can see in the example image. 
This app is just my way of making that process faster and a bit more enjoyable.
